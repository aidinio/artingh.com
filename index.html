          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            After finishing high school in 2023, I decided to take a Gap year, and considering that I had fallen in love with the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/"> Haskell</a>
            programming language, I spent a lot of time reading about programming language theory, type theory, and compilers.
    		  </p>

		      <p>
            Just when I was looking for opportunities to get involved in the development of the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> (GHC),
            one thing led to another and I found myself in the middle of the
            <a href="https://haskell.foundation/events/2023-ghc-development-workshop.html">2023 GHC Contributors' Workshop</a> in the beautiful city of ZÃ¼rich.
		      </p>

		       <p>
            There, I met <a href="https://simon.peytonjones.org/">Simon Peyton Jones</a>, and even though I was just 19 years old,
            he offered me a chance to do research with him.
            For the past 23 months, together with Simon and <a href="https://richarde.dev/"> Richard Eisenberg</a>, I've been working
            on formalizing GHC's typechecker. Our work has already been influential in GHC's development, and we've found many <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&author_username=Ei30metry&first_page_size=20">bugs</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/discussions/663"> opportunities for improvement</a> because of it!
          </p>

          <h2>Looking for new opportunities</h2>
          <p>
            As I continue my journey in the world of Haskell, functional programming, and compilers, and considering that the paper's fundamental ideas are crystalizing,
            I am actively looking for job opportunities to apply my knowledge, learn, and gain more experience.
            I would love to work on projects related to Haskell, GHC, functional programming, and compiler development.

            Feel free to get in touch!
          </p>
